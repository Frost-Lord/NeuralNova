# NeuralNova
NeuralNova is an AI-powered chatbot that self-evolves based on user messages. As users interact with the chatbot, the model learns from their input and adapts to better understand and respond to future messages. The chatbot is built using TensorFlow.js to generate natural language responses.

NeuralNova is highly customizable and can be trained on a variety of datasets. The model is trained using supervised learning, with the ability to handle multiple intents and generate appropriate responses for each one.

In addition to its machine learning capabilities, NeuralNova is also equipped with a command-based interface for seamless integration into any messaging platform. Users can interact with NeuralNova using slash commands to initiate specific actions or retrieve information.

Whether you're building a customer support bot, a virtual assistant, or just looking to experiment with the latest in natural language processing, NeuralNova is the perfect tool for creating a highly responsive and intelligent chatbot.
